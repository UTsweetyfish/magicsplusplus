MAGICS++ Version 2.12.2 ( January 2011)

 * Bug fixes (layout, NetCDF handling)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAGICS++ Version 2.12 ( November 2010)

 * NEW threaded contouring
 * NEW use high quality shape files from http://www.naturalearthdata.com/
       for coast lines & rivers 
 * Allow plotting of metgrams from Weather Parameter BUFR files 
       (using Python interface)
 * Improved BUFR synop plotting

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAGICS++ Version 2.10 ( April 2010)

 * NEW object-oriented Python interface (magmacro.py)
 * NEW action routine PIMPORT to include raster graphics into plots (for logos, etc) 
 * Improved BUFR synop plotting
 * Updates on Geopoint interface
 * Clean-up of installation routines
 * Uses Grib_API 1.8x & 1.9.0
 * New object-oriented Python interface (magmacro.py)
 * Test suite is made to compile outside ECMWF
 * Development was driven mainly by Metview 4 developments and WREP
 * Removal of OpenGL driver and replacement through a Qt based driver

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAGICS++ Version 2.8 ( October 2009)

 * Improvements in the graph plotting
 * Improved satellite plotting
 * More options on InputMatrix for irregular grid
 * NEW Introduction of a parameter 'subpage_mapping'. If this parameter is set 
   'automatic', the geographical area will be automatically adjusted to the plotted 
   data. This option is only available for cylindrical and mercator projection. 
   The default is 'user_defined'. Requested by Tigge team.
 * NEW Introduction of a shading technique (parameter contour_shade_technique = 'grid_shading'). 
   This shading technique will attach a colour to each grid point of the grid. 
   No interpolation is performed - a filled box is drawn around each grid point.
 * Improved Taylor diagram

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAGICS++ Version 2.6 ( October 2008)

  * Changes in contouring and shading, including better support for missing data
  * Add rotated grid
  * Bug fixes related to NetCDF cross-sections
  * Better support for multiple POPEN calls 
  * Bug fixes in drivers related to wind plotting
  * Adjustment of Mercator projection
  * Small fix in wind plotting
  * Fix FFT support in raster output (PNG, GIF - only AIX was affected)
  * Smaller bugs fixes and improvements

This release contains the first prototype of a C++ and Python interfaces; please 
contact us if you want to use it.
